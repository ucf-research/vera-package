To access VERA demos, samples, and tutorials, please import samples from the VERA package.

To do so, open the Unity Package Manager (Window -> Package Manager), select the VERA package, click the "Samples" tab, and import any samples you wish by clicking the "Import" button. These samples will be imported into your Assets folder.

There are no samples included in the base VERA package code, and any which you might find are meant for VERA developers. All samples, demos, and tutorials should be imported via the method outlined above.
